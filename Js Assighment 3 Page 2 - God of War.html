                    <p>Kratos, who killed all the Greek gods, appeared in northern Europe. In this ice and snow, he chose to start over: a new marriage and a new son, Kratos named him Atreus. After several years. Kratos's life once again ushered in a sudden change: the death of his wife. According to her wife's wishes, she hopes Kratos and her son will take her ashes to the highest mountain and scatter them. Although he didn't think his son was ready. But he had to leave with his son for the wish of his dead wife. The new insurance Awaits.</p>

                        Atreus is Kratos's son. To be exact. He is Kratos's second child. But today is Kratos's only child and his only future. Perhaps in his eyes, his father is a silent father who doesn't know how to love his children. This may have something to do with Kratos's former Spartan identity: reticent and concise. But for Kratos, he has done his best to love his children. But Atreus didn't understand because he couldn't read his father's heart. He thinks his father always despises himself. Now the young Atreus is ordered by his dead mother to go to the highest mountain with his father. He thought he was qualified enough to take risks. And intend to prove it to his father. But can things really happen? We'll see.
